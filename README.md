# cooking-calendar-client

Cooking calendar is a web application for meal planning. Users will be able have a digital cookbook of recipes that can be entered, tagged, updated, and searched for easily. Those recipes can be assign to specific dates and then a shopping list can be generated to help users save time meal planning. What makes this project a bit more unique is the ability to assign categories to each day of the week so that the app can plan meals for you. 

This project contains all the front end, user interface code for the overall Cooking Calendar app.
